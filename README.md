Exercise 1
A program asks the user to enter their age.

If age is 18 or older, display: "You are eligible to vote."
If age is less than 18, display: "You are not eligible to vote."
End the program.


✔Pseudocode

START
    INPUT age
    IF age >= 18 THEN
        PRINT "You are eligible to vote."
    ELSE
        PRINT "You are not eligible to vote."
    ENDIF
END

Exercise 2
A program takes student marks (0–100).

90 and above → Grade A
75–89 → Grade B
50–74 → Grade C
Below 50 → Fail


 ✔Pseudocode
START
    INPUT marks
    IF marks >= 90 THEN
        PRINT "Grade A"
    ELSE IF marks >= 75 THEN
        PRINT "Grade B"
    ELSE IF marks >= 50 THEN
        PRINT "Grade C"
    ELSE
        PRINT "Fail"
    ENDIF
END

Exercise 3
A program that:

Prompts user to enter 5 numbers
Keeps a running total
Displays the sum
Ends program

✔ Pseudocode
START
    total = 0
    REPEAT 5 TIMES
        INPUT number
        total = total + number
    ENDREPEAT
    PRINT "Total sum = ", total
END

Exercise 4
A program that:

Takes A, B, C as inputs
Finds the largest
Displays result
Ends program


✔ Pseudocode
START
    INPUT A
    INPUT B
    INPUT C
    IF A >= B AND A >= C THEN
        PRINT "A is largest"
    ELSE IF B >= A AND B >= C THEN
        PRINT "B is largest"
    ELSE
        PRINT "C is largest"
    ENDIF
END
